# 🤖 Mini Virtual Assistant (Web-Based)

A web-based **Mini Virtual Assistant** that uses **Speech Recognition** and **Text-to-Speech** technologies to interact with users through voice commands.
This project demonstrates the practical use of **JavaScript Web APIs** to build an intelligent, user-friendly assistant.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The Mini Virtual Assistant listens to user voice input, converts it into text, processes commands, and responds back using synthesized speech.
It is designed as a lightweight, browser-based assistant without any external server dependency.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* To understand and implement **Speech Recognition** in web applications
* To implement **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** using JavaScript
* To build an interactive voice-controlled interface
* To enhance frontend skills using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5** – Structure of the web page
* **CSS3** – Styling and UI design
* **JavaScript** – Core logic and voice processing
* **Web Speech API** – Speech Recognition & Speech Synthesis

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User clicks the microphone button
2. Assistant listens to the user's voice
3. Voice input is converted into text
4. Assistant processes the command
5. Response is spoken back using a **female voice**
